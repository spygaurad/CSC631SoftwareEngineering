# CSC-631-AG-Software Engineering

This repository contains the assignments and tasks assigned in the CSC-631-AG-Software Engineering class.

## Programs

This repository contains two main programs:

1.  **Binary Calculation Module:** This module provides functions for performing basic binary calculations. See the documentation in `BinaryCalculation/BinaryCalculation.md` for details.

2.  **LangGraph AI Demo:** This program demonstrates the use of LangChain to create an agent that interacts with a language model and custom tools for binary calculations. The program uses the Google Gemini language model and three custom tools for binary calculations. See the documentation within the file `LangGraphAIDemo/langgraph_router.py` for details.

To run the LangGraph AI demo, execute the following command:

```bash
python -m LangGraphAIDemo.langgraph_router
```

Remember to set your Gemini API key in a `.env` file before running the demo.
